            The mission of our project of generating electricity from exothermic reactions is to explore sustainable and innovative ways to harness energy. By focusing on converting the heat released from exothermic reactions into usable electrical energy, your project aims to contribute to the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. It can also highlight the importance of utilizing waste heat from industrial processes to generate electricity efficiently. This project can promote environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.

          When reactants are mixed together, collisions between atoms take place. In 1880, Svante Arrhenius proposed that the atoms must posses some minimum amount of energy for a reaction to occur which is called the threshold energy. At times this energy is already possessed in the molecules and no external agent is required for the reaction to begin. However, sometimes the reaction to begin some external energy is required to be given which is known as the activation energy.
          This energy is required to break the pre-existing bonds of the compounds. Once the pre-existing bonds are broken, new bonds tend to form with the creation of new products. This process tends to absorb energy. 
          Hence a conclusion can be drawn that a chemical reaction involves the release and subsequent absorption of energy. 
          At times, there is an imbalance of energy during the reaction which causes energy to be either released or absorbed.
          Endothermic reaction – When the threshold energy is greater than the released energy endothermic reaction occurs. 
          Exothermic reaction – When the threshold energy is less than the released energy exothermic reaction occurs.
          We have thoroughly researched and found out that,

          <b id="as">Fe2O3 + 2Al -> 2Fe+ Al2O3</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          This is a exothermic reaction which releases heat in a very large amount, 
          According to enthalpic calculations, 1 mole of the reaction produces 851.5 KJ of heat is produced.
          To boil 100 litres of water, approximately, 47.9 kg Rust is required to combine with 16.18 kg of Aluminium.
          100 kg of steam will produce approximately 115,700 kJ (or 115.7 MJ) of energy in a steam turbine with an efficiency of 85%.
          Our project aims to generate electricity from the heat produced due to exothermic chemical reactions.
